# How to hire developers

This document outlines my process for hiring remote developers for an existing software product and an existing team. 
The purpose of this document is to manage expectations with both business people and developers.
I want to make my process understandable, make clear why I am doing things and
have fewer disappointments through better management of expectations. 

I hope my memo also serves guidelines for other companies who look to work with the top 
remote developers of the world. 

# Hires for an existing software product

In this hiring process, we are hiring developers for existing product development.

* The current company and its management is well-versed in their product and industry vertical, 
  thus there is no need to buy a solution

* The current management knows what is good development and what is bad

* There is no set end date for the contract, as there would be with a project-based work

* There are existing developer culture, workflow and team members in-place

* There are in-house project managers and quality assurance 

* Generally, hiring is to find developers that would integrate to the existing team

# What is talent and where to find it

In software development, up to certain organisation size, 
it makes sense to get the best developers even you would pay a daring premium for it. 
This is because in software development 
productivity scales faster than compensation. There is a myth of 20x performers. 
In real, the performance of a senior, enthusiastic expert is 3x - 4x and the compensation 2x-3x, a good business trade-off to be made.

To get the best developers, you need to make sure 

1. The best developers find you

2. Your organisation is seen as exciting and a fun place to work

3. Developers get feeling the team is expert in what are doing,
  as when experts work with other experts, there are high expectations,
  less friction and high satisfaction of doing challenging deliveries 

This memo you are reading is part of 1. and 2. - I want to set high expectations
for myself and people contacting me, so that they will go to an extra effort
to create a quality relationship. 

I want to make the hiring process as open and wide reaching as possible,
so that I can process high number of candidates efficiently. 
Partly because you never know where the good talent lurks, partly
because I believe into democratising opportunites, partly because
it is how I bootstrapped my career and I want to give others
the same chances. More about this below. 
  
# Hiring remote workers and outsourced developers

Software development is a rare skill and profession, which can be executed from anywhere.
It is very democratic and meritocratic in sense that as long as you can access internet,
you can learn it and you can find work. The rest is up to you: how hard you 
push to learn and work. Well-known high quality software oriented companies like 
Github, Ubuntu and 37 Signals (Basecamp) were built this way.

I also dare to claim that to find the top talent, rock star developers or
20x performers, however you want to call it, it makes sense to go fish
further to the ocean. Thus, to build a good developer organisation we need
to be able to board people from anywhere, no matter what is their background.

* Need to have overlapping working hours with the team - 
  usually with e.g. Indians this happens by people in India shifting their
  working hours to match the Western business hours 
  
* Need to be able to work independently - do not stop if you encounter 
  an issue, but make sure you proactively ask for help and report
  you cannot continue

* Need to be motivated - even if there are people not watching you 
  or socialising you, you can focus on work and do not wander 
  off to social media

# Types of offerors

When you hiring contractors or employees, you can source developers primarily three ways

* Direct hires, employees or freelancers 

* Through an outsourcing agency

* Through a recruitment agency 

I do not discriminate how the 

The main difference between recruitment and outsourcing agencies is how they are compensated.

The recruitment agency takes a one-time bonus for making the hire. Their specialty is the distribution
network, or wide reach for the offer ad. The traditional recruitment agencies usually have little or no
insight into the quality of candidates, although there exist nowadays more specialised platforms
to cater the hiring of the software development world. 

Outsourcing agencies price their margin in the hourly or monthly compensation of the developer.
The outsourcing agency maintains the corporate structure for the developer. 
They do more long term commitments and also can offer usually more than 
one individual developer. The margin with outsourcing agencies vs. paying direct
salary varies between 25% - 50%, so it might be a little bit expensive in the long run.

Freelancers, or individuals, take care of themselves. There is the least overhead working
with people directly.  

# Asking the price

I will ask the price before engaging to the further discussion. This is 
because usually you first deal with business people before you can
deal with developers themselves. Furthermore, if the expectations
of the offerors are unrealistic, it is polite not to waste anyone's 
time. 

As our organisation can work with any developers around the world, it means
we can very effectively exploit disparities in the global wealth distribution.
Hiring people from low-income countries is naturally cost-efficient,
as these people need less money for their everyday life.  

However, this does not mean developed countries are automatically excluded.
It makes sense to get the initial offer, or price, from anyone. You might
find surprises. Scottland is not expensive as London and Lapland
is not expensive as Helsinki. Also, if the developer is really really
good, I am happy to pay 5x premium for 20x productivity. 

Also, there are very motivated, very talented people, who are still making
their way to the working life. I started my freelancer career as 
doing remote hours for a London based education company from Finland,
only for few thousands dollars per month, which was very competitive rate.
Regardless, I was young, but still world class developers and the arrangement
suited for my life situation - local companies could pay me little bit more,
but I would have needed to work with Nokia's software supplier and
code C++ for Symbian platform, a horror with frustrations and motivation. 

## Developer talk

If the offers are not outrageous, then it comes down to judge 
how good people's skills are and how to pick. 

Some factors to consider

* **Domain specific knowledge**: 
 Even though a good developer can learn any new technology,
 for a startup companies time-to-market is important. 
 The HR resources that can be invested to training are scarce.
 Thus, it makes sense to prefer developers with knowledge
 of the existing development stack. 

* Basic communication skills are must. Vocal English is 
  less important than written English. Besides be able
  to understand English as a language, one need to be 
  able to express themselves
